    NOTE: Learning Web Development has begun to burn me out. I need a bit of fun... Therefore, the intent for this site is simply for me to learn by playing. The code will probably not always be DRY. However, it will be refactored once the project is completly finished. If you are a hiring manager or are considering me for a postion for web develoment -- please do not judge to harshly on this project. I just need a study break and some fun. When I taught art I found that you can teach theory and have students reaching for perfection all day long. But first you must let them explore their materials, mediums and substrate. This develops passion, excitement, joy and curiosity. It also helps the student build confidence in thier craft. Play is a great way to reestablish the notion that failing is okay- IFailing is part of the process of learning. SIDE NOTE: The background image was inspired by Kandinsky. Basically I am an artist who turned Graphic designer who is turning web developer. Honestly, if I could do it again, I would have turned my fun time of building geo-cites in the late 90's and early 2000's into a college degree. But this is where my journey has led me. Mid-30 something, and I finally know what I want to do as a career, and a hobby. Today is Feb. 5th 2021, and I started teaching myself code on Aug. 6th 2020. 6 months in and I am still pushing along! TOOT TOOT!!!  MrsG-ood (the G is my last name reference, and the ood is a Doctor Who reference. Just.... in case your curious.)
